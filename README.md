The title says it all

## How to use

1. Fork this repository
2. Edit the `index.html` as you like! Some notable edit points are:
   - Replace `<head> > <link rel=icon>` tag's 'ðŸ§©' emoji with your emoji of choice. or you can just use your own favicon.ico or delete the tag entirely.
   - Replace `<body> > <h1>` tag's content
   - Replace `<body> > <footer>` tag's content including the `<a>` tag's `href` attribute
